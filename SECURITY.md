### Responsible disclosure policy
At Cypherock, we believe that coordinated vulnerability disclosure is the right approach to better protect users. Please go through the [bug bounty](https://www.cypherock.com/bug-bounty) page on the Cypherock website to learn about the process to be followed when submitting a vulnerability report. Please report suspected vulnerabilities in private to bounty@cypherock.com.
